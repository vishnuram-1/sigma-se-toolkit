# Sigma Financial Reconciliation Workbook Skill

Generate / edit / audit Sigma reconciliation workbooks. This is a
**workbook-pattern skill** — it prescribes what a recon workbook should look
like, leaving field-level mechanics to `sigma-data-models`.

## When this skill is the right one

- User says "reconciliation," "tie-out," "GL recon," "variance dashboard," or
  describes comparing two source ledgers and surfacing differences.
- User has, or can produce, two sources: a "book" (e.g. GL) and a "compare"
  (e.g. sub-ledger, bank statement, ERP feed).

If the request is a generic financial dashboard (P&L, cash flow, AR aging) with
no compare-and-variance pattern, this is NOT the right skill — fall back to
`sigma-data-models` + `sigma-workbook-conventions`.

## Prerequisites

1. `sigma-api` skill has produced `$SIGMA_API_TOKEN`.
2. The two source tables (book + compare) exist as Sigma sources or warehouse
   tables the credentialed account can read.
3. A join key exists between book and compare (transaction ID, account+date+amount, etc.).

## Canonical structure

Every recon workbook produced by this skill should have these pages, in order:

1. **Overview** — KPI tiles: `total_book`, `total_compare`, `total_variance`,
   `pct_matched`. One headline visualization (variance over time).
2. **Variance Trend** — time series of `abs(book - compare)` by period. Include
   a period control and a category drill (account, entity, etc.).
3. **Variance Detail** — record-level join of book vs compare with delta column,
   match flag, and aging bucket. This is the workbench for analysts.
4. **Exceptions** — filtered Detail showing only `flag_matched = false`, sorted
   by `abs(delta)` desc. Add an action column (notes / status) for follow-up.
5. **Reference: Mapping** (optional) — account/code mapping table if the recon
   requires translating between book and compare taxonomies.

## Canonical KPIs

Names follow `sigma-workbook-conventions`. Define every recon workbook with
at least these:

| Metric ID | Definition | Format |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| `total_book` | sum of book-side amount | currency |
| `total_compare` | sum of compare-side amount | currency |
| `total_variance` | `total_book - total_compare` | currency, signed |
| `abs_variance` | `abs(total_variance)` | currency |
| `count_unmatched` | rows where `flag_matched = false` | integer |
| `pct_matched` | `1 - count_unmatched / count_total` | percent, 1 decimal |
| `aging_bucket` | bucketing of unmatched age (0–7d, 8–30d, 31–90d, 90d+) | categorical |

## Standard controls

- `period_control` — date range bound to the book-side date column.
- `entity_control` — multi-select on entity/legal-entity dimension.
- `account_control` — multi-select on account dimension.
- `materiality_control` — numeric threshold; rows with `abs(delta) < threshold`
  are excluded from the Exceptions page only.

## Exemplar

`examples/exemplar-spec.json` is the anchor. **It is currently a stub** — replace
it with a real exported recon workbook from the user's Sigma org by calling
`GET /v2/workbooks/{workbookId}/spec` (with `Accept: application/json`) on a
known-good recon dashboard, then refresh `reference/structure.md` and
`reference/kpis.md` to match the real exemplar. Skill stays valuable even
without the exemplar but is much sharper with it.

## Reference

- `reference/structure.md` — page-by-page breakdown with element lists.
- `reference/kpis.md` — full metric definitions (formula, format, dependencies).

For field-level questions (how to express a metric, how relationships work,
how column-level security applies) defer to `sigma-data-models/reference/`
in the upstream skill (mirrored at `vendor/sigma-agent-skills/`).
