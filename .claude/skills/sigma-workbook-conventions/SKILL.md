# Sigma Workbook Conventions

Project-wide conventions for Sigma workbook/data-model specs. Read this before
generating or editing any `spec.json` in `workbooks/` or `examples/`.

## Inputs

This skill is reference-only — no scripts. It assumes:

- The user has already authenticated via the `sigma-api` skill.
- `sigma-data-models` is available for endpoint mechanics and field semantics.
- The local mirror at `vendor/sigma-agent-skills/` is available to consult when a
  field-level question isn't answered here.

## Session modes

Sessions in this workspace run in one of two modes, signaled by an
explicit phrase in the user's first message:

| Mode | Trigger | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Training** (default) | `initialize training mode session` | Full agentic co-development. Propose plans, ask clarifying questions, surface inference choices, and after the build promote recurring findings into skills / reference / memory. Recommend skill modifications when a pattern recurs. |
| **Test** | `initialize test mode session` | Build-only. Focus exclusively on producing the requested workbook using this skill as it currently exists. Do NOT propose skill modifications. Do NOT offer to promote findings. Do NOT editorialize about the iteration process. Solve blockers quietly within the build. The skill is treated as fixed reference material. |

If neither phrase is used at init, default to training mode.

**Why two modes:** test mode supports recording demo videos for
customers. The spotlight in those demos is on what Sigma + Claude can
deliver right now, not on the meta-process of co-developing the skill.
Skill-promotion chatter (even when valuable) pollutes the demo
narrative.

The rest of this skill — the plan-first workflow, naming, gotchas, and
reference material — applies in both modes. The only thing test mode
suppresses is the meta-layer where you'd normally surface findings for
future skill improvement.

## Workflow: propose a plan before building

Workbook prompts often underspecify the dashboard — the user names the data
and the question, not the visualizations or the filter set. Do not jump
straight to JSON. Before authoring any spec, surface a written plan and
wait for explicit approval.

The plan must include:

1. **Data inventory.** What table(s) and which columns are actually
   available — pulled from `GET /v2/dataModels/{id}/spec`, not assumed.
   Name any column that's missing from your assumed schema (e.g. there
   *is* a customer dimension; there *isn't* a margin field) so the user
   can correct before you build on a wrong premise.
2. **Inference rationale.** For each visualization you propose, one line
   on *why this chart, this dimension, this metric* answers the user's
   question. "Quantity, not revenue, because popularity is a unit-volume
   question" beats "bar chart of products."
3. **Filter set with reasoning.** Filters aren't free — each one earns
   its place by mapping to an axis the user is likely to interrogate.
   List the filters in priority order with a one-line reason, and note
   what you considered and dropped.
4. **Layout sketch.** A textual block-diagram of the page is enough
   (header / KPI row / chart grid / detail). Don't draw the XML yet.
5. **Open decisions.** Anywhere you had to guess (proxy for a missing
   dimension, scope of demographic data to bring in, whether to modify a
   shared data model). Phrase as questions the user can yes/no.

Only after the user approves should you write spec JSON. This convention
exists because rebuilding a wrong dashboard costs more iterations than
the 60 seconds spent writing the plan, and because the user can correct
data-model assumptions you'd otherwise discover at POST time.

If the user has already given you an explicit plan, skip to building —
don't re-propose.

## Conventions

### Naming

- **Pages** use Title Case ("Variance Detail", not "variance_detail" or "variance detail").
- **Columns** use snake_case for IDs and Title Case for display labels.
- **Metrics** start with a verb: `total_revenue`, `count_orders`, `avg_ticket`. Display labels stay human-readable ("Total Revenue").
- **Filters/Controls** are named after the dimension they bind to, suffixed with `_filter` or `_control`.
- Avoid Sigma's auto-generated names (`Calculation 1`, `Filter 2`); always rename before saving an iteration.

### Page/folder layout

- First page = **Overview** (KPI tiles + a single primary visualization).
- Subsequent pages drill from coarse → fine: Overview → Trend → Detail → Exception list.
- Group related controls into a single Filter Bar at the top of each page rather than scattering.
- Use folder groupings for any model with >10 elements; flat models are hard to read.

### ID semantics (CRITICAL)

When round-tripping specs, IDs behave differently per operation:

- **CREATE (POST):** Sigma remaps IDs server-side. Don't depend on the IDs you sent.
- **GET:** Returned IDs are source-of-truth. Save them.
- **UPDATE (PUT):** Existing IDs MUST be preserved. New elements added in an UPDATE
  body are assigned new IDs. Do not reuse a deleted element's ID.

When generating a spec from scratch, use stable human-readable placeholder IDs
(`col_revenue`, `metric_total_revenue`); after the first POST, GET back the
authoritative spec and use it as the new baseline.

### Constraints (from upstream `sigma-data-models`)

- Partial updates are NOT supported — both CREATE and UPDATE require the complete spec.
- A single model cannot contain multiple identically-named tables.
- Input tables, Python elements, and references to other Sigma elements in custom
  SQL are **not supported** by the round-trip endpoints. Avoid generating these.

### Secrets

- Never bake `$SIGMA_API_TOKEN`, `$SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET`, or any credential into a
  spec, prompt, or note file.
- Do not write tokens to files under the workspace.
- Tokens belong only in the `Authorization` header.

### Iteration hygiene

- Save each generation attempt under `workbooks/<name>/iterations/<timestamp>.json`
  alongside the prompt that produced it in `prompts/<timestamp>.md`. This makes
  diffs across attempts cheap and turns each session into evidence.
- When a fix recurs across 2+ iterations, promote the rule into this file or into
  a domain skill's `reference/`. See `docs/iteration-playbook.md`.

## Common pitfalls

1. Generating fields the round-trip endpoint doesn't support (input tables, Python).
2. Keeping Sigma's auto-generated names; downstream readers can't tell what they do.
3. Reusing a stale ID from an earlier CREATE response after an UPDATE.
4. Embedding controls inside a single page when they should be model-level so
   they can drive multiple pages.
5. Forgetting that columns must reference an existing source — declare sources first.

## Workbook spec gotchas (load `reference/workbook-spec-api.md` BEFORE authoring)

For workbook specs specifically (not data models), eight rules from past
iteration failures:

1. **No implicit column inheritance.** A chart sourced from a sibling table
   must redeclare every column it references. The CREATE endpoint accepts
   broken specs that fail silently at render time.
2. **Set explicit `name` on every column referenced by a sibling element.**
   Inferred names (passthrough formulas with no `name` field) work in a
   GET-back exemplar but fail at POST time with `dependency not found`.
   Always write `name: "Date"` etc. on columns that downstream KPIs,
   charts, or controls will reference by display name.
3. **Verify data-model columns resolve before building on them.** A
   column listed in `GET /v2/dataModels/{id}/spec` is not guaranteed to be
   queryable from a workbook — orphaned/stale columns can pass through
   the data-model spec and still fail formula resolution. When pulling
   newer/unfamiliar columns, do a minimal one-table POST as a probe
   first; if it returns 400, source from the warehouse table directly.
4. **Always check the data model's `metrics` first.** Use `[Metrics/<Name>]`
   instead of redoing aggregations in the workbook — preserves formatting
   (currency, percent) and keeps a single source of truth. Caveat:
   metrics live on data-model elements only. Warehouse-sourced workbook
   tables have no access — replace with inline `Sum(...)` aggregations.
5. **Controls bind by column `id`, not name.** `filters[].columnId` must
   match a column id you've declared on the target element.
6. **Visualization clarity is non-negotiable.** Every page gets a title
   `text` element at the top (workbook `name` is metadata, not a visible
   heading); every chart/KPI gets a descriptive `name`; KPIs over time-series
   metrics get a date-dimension column for sparkline + period comparison;
   KPIs need ~8–10 grid rows of height for the sparkline to read.
7. **Use containers for page structure.** Wrap related elements (header
   bar, KPI row + chart) in `kind: container` elements with `<GridContainer>`
   layout XML so the page reads as logical blocks rather than a flat grid.
8. **Omit column `format` at POST.** The `format` object requires a
   `kind` field whose exact shape is undocumented; specs that include
   `format` are rejected with `Missing "kind" field`. Configure currency
   /percent formatting in the UI and rely on GET-back to learn the shape.

Full patterns, source kinds, formula namespaces, KPI/text/container shapes,
GridContainer layout XML, and the page-structure pattern live in
`reference/workbook-spec-api.md`. Always visually verify the workbook in
the UI after a CREATE — the API doesn't validate cross-element column
resolution or visualization quality.

## Reference and examples

- `reference/naming.md` — naming rubric.
- `reference/workbook-spec-api.md` — endpoints, source kinds, column rule,
  formula namespaces, control wiring, KPI shape, kind mismatches,
  visualization clarity. **Read this before authoring any workbook spec.**
- `examples/` — known-good specs to seed generation. Treat as immutable
  references; clone-and-modify rather than editing in place.

For data-model field-level mechanics (columns, metrics, relationships,
filters, controls, formatting, folders, column-level security, workflows)
defer to the upstream `sigma-data-models` skill — its `reference/` folder is
the authoritative answer for those topics.
